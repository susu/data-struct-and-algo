Data structures and algorithms
==============================

In this repository I (will) create some exercise with data structures and algorithms.

Please note the following:

  * They are only for learning purposes, not for real-world usage!
  * There will not be hacky, low-level optimizations
  * There are errors, bugs, etc in the code.
  * You can learn from them, but there can be errors in concepts and in my understanding.
  * C++11 compliant compiler required (we're not living in stone-age)

Main goals:

  * Learning, learning, ...
  * TDD/BDD
